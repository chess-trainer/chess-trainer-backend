# chess-trainer

## Summary:

A routine in advanced chess training involves improving visualization skills. Several websites exist that offer chess tactics (short puzzles) but very few (if not none) have tactics that focus on visualization development (no board) (e.g. white: Kh6, Qh1; black: Kh8; white to move).

We would like to create a website that offers that kind of training. Since it is a large stepping stone from the conventional tactics, we will also present tactics over a blank board with a list of piece locations (like in the visualize).


## Future:

This base project is relatively simple. We hope to expand our website to create a chess training website.

### Features:

* **Opening training:** Much like flashcards, users give us their opening repertoire and are then able to learn it through repetition. Everytime they make a move in the trainer, the trainer will respond with a move within their repertoire. If they play a move that is not part of their repertoire, we will flag them (or maybe offer to put it in the repertoire).

* **Account linking:** Websites like lichess.org, chess.com, and chess24.com are very popular for playing games. We would like to implement a way to link their accounts to our website so that everytime they play a game there, we will receive the game and perform analytics automatically.

* **Famous game training:** One really important part of getting better at chess is seeing what top players have played. We would like to implement a training mode where you go through famous games, and later, you are given random positions from those games where you play as the player who won and try to recant their winning methodology.

* **Strategical puzzles:** Tactics in chess involve positions with short winning combinations. On the other hand, strategical puzzles involve trying to find plans in positions (e.g. move rooks to g and h file, and push g and h pawns while using bishop to infiltrate dark squares). This is particularly difficult if we don't hardcode it, and will likely require machine learning.

* **Chess TV:** Show live games being played at top events.

* **ChessDB:** Chess database of all top players.

* **OpeningsDB:** Openings database with names of openings, key ideas, and theory (known moves).
